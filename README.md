Calculate FOV and Angles for Triple Screens
Calculate the correct Field of View (FOV) and angles for triple screen configuration for all Sim Racing games, including Assetto Corsa Rally, Assetto Corsa EVO, iRacing, Automobilista, rFactor, Le Mans Ultimate, DiRT Rally, and Richard Burns Rally.

🏎️ How to Calculate Field of View
Enter your measurements: Input your monitor measurements and viewing distance.

Aspect Ratio: Make sure you know your screen's aspect ratio (this really makes a big difference!).

🎯 Understanding the FOV Result
After entering your monitor measurements and seating position, you'll see a list of FOV (Field of View) values for various sim racing games.

These numbers represent the optimal viewing angle for your configuration, helping to create a more immersive and realistic driving experience. A properly set FOV ensures that objects in the game appear with the correct size and distance relative to your real-world perspective.

Benefits
This can significantly improve your spatial awareness on track, allowing for better judgment of corners, braking points, and overtaking opportunities.

Horizontal vs. Vertical FOV
For most simulators, you'll see a Horizontal FOV (hFOV) value. This is the side-to-side viewing angle and is typically the value you'll need to enter in the game settings.

Some games, like Assetto Corsa Rally, use Vertical FOV (vFOV) instead, which represents the top-to-bottom angle.

Adaptation and Performance
Remember, while a correct FOV might initially feel unusual if you're used to a wider, unrealistic setting, give yourself time to adapt. Many Sim Racers report greater consistency and faster lap times after getting accustomed to a properly calculated FOV.

Correct FOV means better lap times!

🖥️ Triple Screen Configuration
If you have a triple screen setup, pay attention to the "Triple Screen Horizontal FOV" value in the calculator results.

This helps you set the correct angle between your monitors for seamless viewing across all three screens.

Final Note
These calculations provide a strong starting point. Feel free to make small adjustments based on personal preferences, but try to stay close to these values for the most authentic driving experience.

Note: This utility supports calculations for both single and triple screen setups, with special consideration for racing simulator configurations including tilted side screens.
