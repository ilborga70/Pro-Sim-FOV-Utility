# Changes v2.0
- Input Controls: Enhanced ComboBox behavior for Screen Ratio and Screens by setting them to DropDownList style, preventing manual text entry and improving stability.
- Result Display: The results box has been streamlined by removing scrollbars and setting the cursor to a default arrow to emphasize its read-only nature.
- Trigonometry Engine: Refined the FOV calculation logic to better handle curved screens and triple-screen angles.

## 📢 Latest Updates

Pro-Sim FOV Utility v1.0.0.0
- Changelog:
- Now the executable file "Pro-Sim FOV Utility.exe" does not require to be run as administrator.
- Single-File Portability: The application icon is now embedded directly into the script (Base64).
- The utility is now fully standalone and no longer requires the external ico folder to function.
- Changed the monitor ratio value to standard instead of 16:9

## 🏁  Why Pro-Sim FOV Utility Is Superior
* **🔍  Beyond Geometry**
Traditional calculators rely only on a distance ÷ width formula.
Pro-Sim integrates human physiology and spatial perception, ensuring realism that pure math cannot achieve.
* **👀  120° Binocular Vision Reference**
Human vision spans 200°–220°, but binocular overlap (both eyes working together) is ~120°.
This is the critical zone where the brain fuses depth and perspective.
Pro-Sim’s choice: Align FOV with binocular vision → a 1:1 “Royal Flush” simulation.
Result: Eliminates fisheye distortion (too wide) and tunnel vision (too narrow).
* **🌀  Peripheral Vision Correction***
Central vision (~60°) handles detail, but peripheral vision drives speed perception.
Pro-Sim ensures that edge-of-screen cues are processed naturally, so drivers feel velocity without staring at the speedometer.
Triple-screen setups especially benefit from this correction.
* **🏎️  Precision for Richard Burns Rally (RBR)**
RBR’s graphics engine uses a nonlinear FOV calculation, unlike most modern sims.
Standard calculators misinterpret this, producing distorted results.
Pro-Sim applies a custom mathematical transformation tailored to RBR’s code.
Guarantees perfect geometry on 16:9 and 21:9 monitors, restoring cockpit realism.
* **🎯  The Bottom Line**
Pro-Sim FOV Utility is not just a calculator — it’s a vision simulator.
By combining monitor geometry + biology of vision, it ensures that every millimeter of asphalt displayed matches the distance your brain expects in reality.
Pro-Sim FOV Utility is a portable, high-precision tool designed to calculate the correct Field of View (FOV) and angles for Sim Racing setups.
Whether you use a single monitor or a triple-screen configuration, this tool ensures accurate perspective for titles like *Assetto Corsa*, *iRacing*, *Automobilista 2*, and more.

### New FOV Values Assetto Corsa Rally
* **New ACR Dashboard View**
* **New ACR Cockpit View**
### `fix(calc)`: Assetto Corsa Rally Correction
* **Horizontal FOV Adjustment:** Corrected the FOV calculation for *Assetto Corsa Rally* to use **Horizontal FOV (hFOV)** instead of Vertical FOV (vFOV). The value now aligns correctly with other hFOV-based titles like AMS2 and iRacing.

### 🚀 Dynamic Preview Refinements
* **Live Inch Conversion:** The distance measurement line now displays values in **inches** alongside centimeters for immediate utility.
* **Cleaner Interface:** Angle and mode labels have been moved from the center to a dedicated column in the **top-left corner**. This prevents text overlap when the virtual pilot's head is close to the screens.
* **Sync Fixes:** Resolved a bug where toggling inputs (Curved Screen, Bezel, etc.) caused the Triple Screen Angle to display outdated values. Calculations now run strictly before the drawing routine.

## ✨ Key Features

### 💾 Profile Management
Save time by storing different setup configurations (e.g., "Desk Rig" vs. "Main Sim Rig").
* **Save Profile:** Serializes current configuration to a `.json` file.
* **Load Profile:** Deserializes the file and automatically repopulates all sliders, checkboxes, and values. The preview diagram instantly updates to reflect the loaded profile.

### 📊 Professional Image Reports
Generate shareable, professional screenshots of your setup data.
* **Custom Backgrounds:** Automatically overlays text results on a custom car cockpit background (`img\cockpit_template.png`).
* **Clean Layout:** 1280x720 PNG output with a two-column design separating input parameters from calculated results.
* **Styling:** Features a dark, semi-transparent overlay for readability and branding-consistent borders.

### 👁️ Dynamic Visual Diagram
A real-time visual representation of your rig that updates instantly as you adjust sliders.
* **Triple Screen Logic:** Accurately visualizes side screens tilted at specific angles (defaulting to 30°) and joined to the center screen.
* **Bezel Integration:** Visually represents bezel thickness between screens.
* **Head Position:** An oval represents the user, moving dynamically based on distance settings.
* **FOV Lines:** Yellow dashed lines indicate the actual Field of View angle.

## 🎓 Why Calculate FOV?

**Correct FOV means better lap times.**

1.  **Speed Perception:** A properly set FOV ensures objects appear at the correct size and distance relative to your real-world perspective. This fixes the "false" feeling of speed often caused by overly wide default settings.
2.  **Spatial Awareness:** Improves judgment for braking points, corner apexes, and distance to other cars.
3.  **Consistency:** While a mathematically correct FOV might feel "zoomed in" at first, adapting to it typically leads to greater consistency and faster lap times.

> **Note for Triple Screens:** Pay close attention to the "Triple Screen Horizontal FOV" and angle values in the results. These ensure a seamless transition across all three monitors.
