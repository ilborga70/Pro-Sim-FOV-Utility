**Pro-Sim FOV Utility** is a portable, high-precision tool designed to calculate the correct Field of View (FOV) and angles for Sim Racing setups. Whether you use a single monitor or a triple-screen configuration, this tool ensures accurate perspective for titles like *Assetto Corsa*, *iRacing*, *Automobilista 2*, and more.

## 📢 Latest Updates

### `fix(calc)`: Assetto Corsa Rally Correction
* **Horizontal FOV Adjustment:** Corrected the FOV calculation for *Assetto Corsa Rally* to use **Horizontal FOV (hFOV)** instead of Vertical FOV (vFOV). The value now aligns correctly with other hFOV-based titles like AMS2 and iRacing.

### 🚀 Dynamic Preview Refinements
* **Live Inch Conversion:** The distance measurement line now displays values in **inches** alongside centimeters for immediate utility.
* **Cleaner Interface:** Angle and mode labels have been moved from the center to a dedicated column in the **top-left corner**. This prevents text overlap when the virtual pilot's head is close to the screens.
* **Sync Fixes:** Resolved a bug where toggling inputs (Curved Screen, Bezel, etc.) caused the Triple Screen Angle to display outdated values. Calculations now run strictly before the drawing routine.

## ✨ Key Features

### 💾 Profile Management
Save time by storing different setup configurations (e.g., "Desk Rig" vs. "Main Sim Rig").
* **Save Profile:** Serializes current configuration to a `.json` file.
* **Load Profile:** Deserializes the file and automatically repopulates all sliders, checkboxes, and values. The preview diagram instantly updates to reflect the loaded profile.

### 📊 Professional Image Reports
Generate shareable, professional screenshots of your setup data.
* **Custom Backgrounds:** Automatically overlays text results on a custom car cockpit background (`img\cockpit_template.png`).
* **Clean Layout:** 1280x720 PNG output with a two-column design separating input parameters from calculated results.
* **Styling:** Features a dark, semi-transparent overlay for readability and branding-consistent borders.

### 👁️ Dynamic Visual Diagram
A real-time visual representation of your rig that updates instantly as you adjust sliders.
* **Triple Screen Logic:** Accurately visualizes side screens tilted at specific angles (defaulting to 30°) and joined to the center screen.
* **Bezel Integration:** Visually represents bezel thickness between screens.
* **Head Position:** An oval represents the user, moving dynamically based on distance settings.
* **FOV Lines:** Yellow dashed lines indicate the actual Field of View angle.

## 🎓 Why Calculate FOV?

**Correct FOV means better lap times.**

1.  **Speed Perception:** A properly set FOV ensures objects appear at the correct size and distance relative to your real-world perspective. This fixes the "false" feeling of speed often caused by overly wide default settings.
2.  **Spatial Awareness:** Improves judgment for braking points, corner apexes, and distance to other cars.
3.  **Consistency:** While a mathematically correct FOV might feel "zoomed in" at first, adapting to it typically leads to greater consistency and faster lap times.

> **Note for Triple Screens:** Pay close attention to the "Triple Screen Horizontal FOV" and angle values in the results. These ensure a seamless transition across all three monitors.
